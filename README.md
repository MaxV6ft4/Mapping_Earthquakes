# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
In this project I modified the existing earthquake map in three ways.  First, I created a new layer group featuring data of the Earth's tectonic plates, writing code to display it as an overlay to the first map when the page loads.  Then, I created another layer group featuring all major earthquakes from the past week.  In this case, major earthquakes consist of those that were registerd as 4.5 or higher on the Richter Scale.  Once the page loads, the other two layers can be unchecked in order to display only the major earthquakes on the map.  Finally I created a third tile layer (dark) to allow the user to choose between streets, satellite streets and dark tiles to view the map according to his or her preference.
